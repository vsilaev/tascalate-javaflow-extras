 *
 * Read-only iterator over multiple results returned by continuation passed 
 * The iterator works similar to <i>yield</i> keyword found in other languages 
 * 
 * Usage:
 * <code>
 * final Runnable code = instantiateContinuableCode();
 * for (final Iterator&lt;String&gt; i = new ContinuationIterator&lt;String&gt;(code); i.hasNext(); ) {
 *   final String line = i.next();
 *   System.out.println( line );
 * } 
 * </code>
 * 
 * Also ContinuationIterator created iterates over multiple values yielded by continuation, 
 * it's impossible to pass value back to continuation from client code; the result of 
 * {@link Continuation#suspend(Object)} in continuation will be always <i>null</i> 
 * 
 * @param <E>
 * Type of objects returned by the iterator
